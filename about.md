## Santosh Vaza
**Principal Software Engineer • Solutions Architect**

Primarily focused on **.NET/C# and Microsoft Azure** — building scalable, cloud-native platforms with strong reliability and operability.

**Dad • Endurance runner**


## Summary

I’m Santosh Vaza — a Principal Software Engineer and Solutions Architect with **13+ years** of experience designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native enterprise applications.

My core expertise is in the Microsoft ecosystem (**.NET, C#, ASP.NET Core, and Azure**), with a practical focus on **system design, performance optimization, security, and production readiness**. I’m comfortable working across the stack when needed, including modern front-end frameworks.

I value clean, maintainable architecture that supports real-world constraints (**latency, cost, operational complexity**) — and I like systems that are **boring in production**: clear boundaries, measurable telemetry, and predictable failure modes.

Outside work, I’m a dad and an endurance runner — I enjoy learning continuously and keeping my engineering decisions grounded in long-term value.



## Highlights

- Cloud & Platform Architecture
- Distributed Systems
- Microservices & DDD
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Performance & Reliability

## Core strengths

### ✅ Pragmatic engineering
Patterns must earn their keep. If complexity increases, the payoff should be obvious (maintainability, scalability, reliability, or speed of delivery).

### ⚖️ Architecture with trade-offs
I optimize for outcomes under constraints (latency, scale, security, and cost), while keeping boundaries and ownership clear.

### 📈 Shipping mindset
Incremental delivery, measurable outcomes, and strong feedback loops via observability and post-incident learning.
